# Module 2: A Developer Centric Experience

These labs will provide hands-on examples that will show you how CloudBees CI enables developers to spend less time on administrative tasks and more time coding. These labs will explore how the CloudBee CI developer centric features provide contextual Jenkins pipeline feedback, in tools such as GitHub and Slack, resulting in less context-switching. These labs will also explore how the scalability and central management of CloudBees CI allows developers to focus on writing and delivering software without being slowed down by their continuous integration tools and processes.
