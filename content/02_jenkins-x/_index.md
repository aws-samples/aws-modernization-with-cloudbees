![EKS and Jenkins X](images/banner.png)

## Welcome

In this workshop you will learn how to quickly get up and running using EKS and Jenkins X. We'll explore how to create a fully operational continuous delivery pipeline using Docker containers, EKS, Jenkins X, and quite a few other tools to establish your Kubernetes-native CI/CD process.

All with the goal of having your developers focus on delivering features fast!

## What You Will Learn
At the end of this workshop, you will have learned how to get up and running with EKS and Jenkins X, run your apps through CI/CD in Jenkins X and publish them to a staging environment.

<p style='text-align: left;'>
You can create your EKS cluster using any method youâ€™d like, such as using the eksctl CLI tool or Terraform.  From the Jenkins X perspective,  how you create your cluster does not matter.  We used eksctl to create the cluster we are working with today.
