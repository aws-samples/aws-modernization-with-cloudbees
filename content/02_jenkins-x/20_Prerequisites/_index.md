# Prerequisites

## GitHub Organization
Most companies will have a GitHub Organization, this is where repositories reside.  It is also important to ensure the Bot account has permissions to said organization.  

In this scenario, I have created a fictitious [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/jenkins-oscar) called Jenkins X Corp.

## Bot Account
The Bot account is in fact a GitHub account, does not have Multi-factor authentication enabled.  It is given the Member Role within the GitHub Organization.
