3. Fill in the required parameters: <p><img src="../../images/workshop-setup-input-form.png" width=400/>
   1. ***githubPat*** - the GitHub Personal Access Token you created above.
   2. The GitHub username/account id you used to create the above GitHub Personal Access Token.
   3. The name of the GitHub Organization you created above specifically for this workshop
   4. The Kubernetes Namespace where your Team Master has been deployed - **only change the default value if you are instructed to do so.**
4. Once you have provided the above required input parameters click the **Run** button at the bottom of the parameters input form.
5. Blue Ocean will automatically switch to the Pipeline **Activity** screen, click anywhere on the Pipeline run row to see the Pipeline run and view the logs. But make sure you don't click on the **Stop** button to the right of the red box in the screenshot below.<p><img src="../../images/workshop-setup-activity.png" width=600/>
6. Once the **core-workshop-setup** Pipeline job completes successfully your Team Master will be restarted so you should see a **Connect lost: waiting** alert in the bottom right of your Blue Ocean screen. <p><img src="../../images/workshop-setup-connection-lost.png" width=600/> <p>You may also experience a **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** screen - that is because the actual Kubernetes Pod that your Team Master is running in is being re-created. Your Team Master will return in a few minutes.
