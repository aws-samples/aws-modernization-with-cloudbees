### Welcome

In this workshop we will learn some best practices around CI/CD that will allow you to rapidly deliver features that will help differentiate your business and reduce time-to-market. 

At your company, Mythical Mysfits, you are launching a new product and your mission is to deliver that product as reliably, quickly and efficiently as you canâ€”while delivering features that set your company apart. Using CloudBees CI, you will configure and manage your own Jenkins server on EKS. This master will build, test and deploy a production-ready application on Amazon EKS. In addition, it will publish, create and push all the infrastructure-as-code requirements for your application to GitHub. This promotes the best practices of DevSecOps combined with GitOps.

### Learning Objectives
- How small, measurable changes drive agility: Build, deploy and test multiple times a day instead of making large complex changes that are difficult to integrate and test
- How to deliver business value rapidly by releasing new features and functionality to customers faster
- How to set up configuration-as-code for your CI/CD tooling (CloudBees CI)
- How to templatize CI/CD pipelines to conform with best practices.  Providing CI/CD as a service for end users
- Ensuring governance and standardization while also empowering developer, security and operations teams by running Jenkins at scale
